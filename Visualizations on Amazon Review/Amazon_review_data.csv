Bhaumik Shah,4.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful packaging same material,7 May 2018,Hi! I have been using this product since really long time. I had a very bad oily skin and I tried most of the good face washes available in the market but from the day i started using this product my pimples are just vanished.Now about the new packaging in bottle then let me tell you you need to be really careful about using this bottle. This bottle dispense more than the desired quantity. So if you are using it for the first time you may end up wasting a lot of quantity.,11 people found this helpful

SajeevTOP 100 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,Removes dirt and is gentle on skin,21 September 2018,Himalaya Neem Facewash leads to a feeling of freshness - you can literally feel your skin pores unclogged. However it does not lead to dryness. Feels great to be able to come home and splash it on and feel fresh. The price for the 300 ml makes it much more inexpensive than going for the smaller size packs. Highly recommend!If you find this review useful then please press the 'Helpful' button. Thanks!,5 people found this helpful

Sijo JoshuaTOP 1000 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,You can face this face wash without any doubts...,2 November 2017, I was using Garnier Acno fight earlier when I came to know about this from one of my friends.GARNIER ACNO FIGHT :Garnier Acno fight is good and I liked it a lot as it is for men and the cooling feel of it after the wash is really amazing. I bought Garnier Acno fight 100g from a nearby store and at first I thought that it won't last for 1 and a half month but to my surprise it lasted for 3 months. I have an oily face and few small pimples. As mentioned in its name Acno fight I thought that it could fight with both but it only worked on my oily face. My pimples are still as it is. My face was oil free for few hours only and after that it was again the same. This facewash made my face really dry after wash. It makes good foam in less amount by the way.The face wash is really hard and cleanses the skin really well. As I have a dark skin tone so after wash I look like I have put white putty on my face and it really looked weird. I thought I must change my face wash and one of my friends recommended about Himalaya Neem Face Wash. I got it on Amazon at a great deal and got the product after few days as expected.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -HIMALAYA NEEM FACE WASH :*What I liked about it*:? It's been a week using this face wash and I feel that it is quite good compared to the earlier one I used.? The best thing I liked about this face wash is that it won't hurt your eyes like Garnier Acno fight does. As Garnier foams great sometimes it got into my eyes while applying and it hurt until I wash it with water.? The face wash is really mild and gentle to my face as it is made of natural ingredients compare to Garnier Acno Fight.? Though it makes my skin dry too and to combat with this I put a small amount of moisturizing cream. But it never made my face like I had put putty on my face though.? As I changed apparently my face wash so my face couldn't tackle it at first and my pimples were still the same for few days. But now it's getting lesser and my face becoming pimple free as I used to this face wash. It will take few days to completely vanish my pimples.? Himalaya neem face wash foam less when I take the same small amount as Garnier face wash.? Sometimes the facewash slips from my hand when I try to foam while rubbing and applying to my face. But I never face this issue while using Garnier Acno fight.? The face wash looks like aloe vera gel and smells really good.*What I didn't like about it and why I rated it 4 star*:? I would suggest you buy rather 100ml or 200ml because the face wash comes out easily from those two and looks convenient to carry anywhere.? Though compare to quantity and price it's a great deal to buy 300ml. I thought the same and made the biggest mistake as the cap is upside down and when I press the bottle the entire face wash comes towards the exit and creates a vacuum at the exit side and the face wash never comes out from where it has to come out no matter how hard I press. I have to remove the cap in order to take the facewash out. I have attached a video as well to show how it looks like actually.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -? You can use 300ml as a refill for 200 ml just like you use refill for your handwash.? I saw that some people faced of the low quantity of facewash when they buy 300ml so to see that I bought a 300ml thumbs-up bottle to check. I have attached an image as well but as you can see It's totally a full 300 ml facewash but just less to 5-10 ml.- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Verdict: Thumbs up for Himalaya Neem face wash but not for it's 300ml bottle.P.S. : My name is Sijo and I'm not a paid reviewer.If you found this review helpful please do support.,6 people found this helpful

M A Parvez,3.0 out of 5 stars,Too Much Hype !!! Is it really work??,6 February 2018,This is the full review of the Himalaya Purifying Neem Face Wash. In this article I covered all there is to know about the product right from its look and feel to its ingredients and also a list of pros and cons to help you make a better well-informed choice. This face wash is probably one of India's most famous face washes and many people claim to see benefits after using this. Read the entire article to find out what I have to say about this!!!!Packaging - 4/5Fragrance - 4/5Verdict - ???With out wasting any time " suru karte hai" ??Starting with the Packaging  I am impressed with the Packaging it's very easy to use but you have to keep it on a dark place (away from sunlight) as it is a plastic bottle.Now taking about it fragrance I am very impressed with its fragrance  it's very good and refreshing.Now let's talk about it ingredients you can see it at the image. Yeah it contains some natural extract like neem and turmeric. But you can see some preservative and colours have been added.ConclusionIf I talk about it cleaning capacity yes it can clean very much and it is soap free  mostly sulfates free and gives a creamy lather not gives too much bubbles which is nice.It says it will decrease the acne and pimples. But I am strongly disagree  it can't prevent any pimples or acne. It will increase your acne and pimples problem bit. You can see irritation on skin.Advantages :- 1- smells good2- cheap3- any bubbles/sulfates free which gives very good creamy lather4- works for almost every skin typeDisadvantages :- 1- the preservatives and colorants used are very bad for your skin2:- Does not help in preventing or treating acne or pimples3:- could cause some breakout on skin.Final verdict:-If you don't mind ingredients then you can go with it for cleaning your face. If you have normal to oily skin then you can use it one time per day but if you have very very oily skin then two times per day. But if you have dry or sensitive skin then I will not recommend it all as it will cause irritation in your face. If you have lots of acne and pimples then it will not work or treat's your acne. It is a average face wash overall.,2 people found this helpful
Shubham,4.0 out of 5 stars,A good product !,10 October 2015,While looking for a normal facewash online my search stopped at this very good product.1. It's a natural herbal product by Himalaya2. 200ml volume is almost enough for a month usage3. A sqeeze bottle simply relieves the tension of doing away with facegel pouches4. The best feature - The bottle has a lock too. So no fear if you're taking it in your travel bag.,5 people found this helpful

I was really helpless but so many positive reviews about THIS face wash urged me to try it and guess what I'm not disappointed. I have visibly less pimples. Also unlike most other facewash products made to fight pimples it does not make the face completely dried up after washing. But yes the oil does return after about 40 mins. I'd recommend it for the ones with skin that's not TOO oily (like somewhere between combination and oily) and suffering from minor pimples.,2 people found this helpful

It's good for a regular face wash but you may want to use one of the expensive ones for special events like parties.This one leaves no side effects. It does not bleach the skin like some other strong face washes do so it’s pretty safe in my view. Also it washes off fairly quickly so you don't have to waste too much water and time in washing it off. It’s a great quick & effective face wash. You get 100 ML for Rs. 100 which I think is very cost effective when compared to other face washes. You also get free shipping from Amazon. No complaints.,23 people found this helpful

WilsonJTOP 500 REVIEWER,4.0 out of 5 stars,Review : Himalaya Neem Face Wash,13 November 2017,Review :It is actually a Neem-based product and I guess everyone is aware about the medicinal and antiseptic properties associated with Neem. The product is specifically meant to maintain a flawless complexion and healthy skin while keeping the skin troubles and disease at bay.This face wash is in gel form and has a very firm pleasant texture and it never smells bad or strange in spite of the presence of turmeric and Neem. It helped me a lot to clear up the excess oil there on my face.Prices:• 15ml – INR 15• 50ml – INR 55• 100ml – INR 130• 150ml – INR 150 and• 200ml – INR 180.I personally prefer the big bottle because of two three reasons… it is in spray form has a very attractive packaging and good quantity.Pros –1. Easily available2. Affordable3. Convenient packaging4. Suitable for Dry skin and Oily Skin.5. Prevents breakouts6. Little product required per usage7. Gentle8. Hygienic9. Budget-buy10. “0” Side effects for sure ?Cons –1. Doesn’t completely cure severe acne breakouts.2. No deep cleansing3.

TechPort AravindTOP 1000 REVIEWER,5.0 out of 5 stars,The Best face Wash I Have Ever Used...!!!,20 March 2018,I absolutely love the packaging of this facewash. The pump makes it so easy to use. It is quite gentle and the fragrance is also very mild.It lathers well and effectively removes oil and dirt and light makeup as well. It also helped me to fight against the pimples to some extent. It makes the skin look oil-free clear and soft. Plus it has the goodness of vitamin E argan oil caffeine and glycerine too. And the smell of the product is amazing. The best face wash I've ever tried.,11 people found this helpful
? Ishita ?,4.0 out of 5 stars,Precautions & Procedure:,4 January 2018,Been Daily using it for 3 months.Initially it worked like a charm but a couple of weeks later.... it slowed down.Surviving Teenage is tough. You face a lot of pimples & acne because of excessive hormones in body. Tough times You lose self-esteem & isolate yourself.I had to take few precautions.I stopped dairy food. No milk No butter No cheese No Ghee.Only Green Leafy Vegetables Carrot Juice daily. Bath with warm water 2 times daily. Use this facewash gently. Don't rub your face. Be polite with your skin.Now I'm thankful to have my great childhood skin back!Eat Healthy! No pizzas & pastas & burgers.,6 people found this helpful

Certified Buyer,1.0 out of 5 stars,Worst for oily skin.,11 August 2017,I have a little oily skin and its worst if you use it in summers on oily skin. It doesn't remove oil from your skin. Honestly I used many facewash but this one is worst . Instead of decreasing pimples it increased my pimples from few to many . I thought its from Himalaya and made up of neem so it would be good but I was wrong . Commonly I don't review products but it was important to aware others. And must Note thing is I used it in summers so season also play an important role in choosing Facewash . ?Note : its my personal experience so I can't say whether it will suit your skin or not but think twice before purchasing it,3 people found this helpful

Amazon Customer,3.0 out of 5 stars,Average product,5 June 2016,The biggest pro of this face wash is that it is very budget friendly.. But from my personal experience i would say that this face wash doesn't seem very helpful for oily skin.. My face again got oily after washing my face with this facewash within just 30 minutes.. However the fragrance is very nice herbal and soothing.. I will recommend this face wash for only normal to dry skinned people.,5 people found this helpful
RS,1.0 out of 5 stars,Not worth the hype,15 September 2017,I don't know why people are so obsessed with this facewash. It doesn't not suit acne prone skin it actually increased my pimples instead of reducing them does not remove make up completely does not suit oily skin. If you have oily acne prone sensitive skin like mine and if you are desperate to find a solution then try some other facewash perhaps one containing glycolic acid and stay away from this face wash. This is a very mild face wash which will suit only normal skin which does not get acne.,One person found this helpful

Willy,3.0 out of 5 stars,I hope to not offend our very own Indian brand,8 April 2017,Himalaya have always produced good quality products in the market from decades and kept their reputation on top so that to reach out to more Indian talking about their brand and all together sharing good value.But its neem face fash..?Yup... I got a tragic question here and i would like to rant further about the same and expect readers to go through it before shedding out any bucks for em.This face wash promises to help out vanish pimples and pimple related bacteria from our face.Okay... However i have noticed a thing after using this face wash on a regular scale thatThis face wash purely fails to prove anything over their package printed promise.Half of the bottle is finished and im yet to see any pimple vanishes over my face.... Anticipating that blemish free pimple free and other-free glowing skin.Im not saying that not even a single pimple have obliterated from my face...If i would like to be evident then i will mention that yeah...the process of pimples vanishing and retracting on my face is an everyday event and this face wash may or may not assisted me helped me getting rid of some of the pimples... But again even before when i was not using this face wash the condition was no so different.Pimples were still going in and out of my face... Just like a pure process.So... I reckon the only way to actually bid good bye to our antagonist ie our very own face pimplesThen Don't just depend on using a face wash and then gorging on other oil stuffed related food.Having a healthy lifestyle first and see you may not even have to apply anything over your face because your coming to a conclusion that outer appearance is not a big thing...

Both of these are known for their benevolent effect upon skin. In combination they can be a great help to those who suffer from acne/pimples. What is more the formulation is very pleasant to use. Being herbal formulations there is no reported side effects -- though all medications herbal or allopathic always need to be tested before one uses them regularly.I highly recommend this herbal face wash.,3 people found this helpful

richa shailendra,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best facewash ever,11 October 2018,My sister's skin is very oily and pimple prone while mine is very sensitive dry on cheeks oily on t-zone and acne prone. So for us it is really difficult to find any product that will suit our skin and not dry it up completely or give us more pimples. This Himalaya face wash is our ONLY consistent face was for almost a decade now! It is THAT GOOD! It suits our skin cleans it does not completely dry it minimizes active pimples. It does not clear old acne marks though and in winters my skin feels very dried up after using it. But I need to use a moisturizer anyway because my skin is weird. My sister finds no reason to start using any other face wash because this is just perfect.,Helpful
